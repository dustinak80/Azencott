# SVM-Project
SVM (Use of SVM Kernels on formed and real data using object-oriented programming)

PROJECT 1:
1) Formed Data using uniform distribution
2) Defined hyperplane by polynomial with degree 4 and used that as separating hyperplane
3) Standardized Data
4) Split data into test and train sets

3) Linear SVM
3.1) Tune the parameter Cost (C) (built class)
3.2) Fit model with best parameters
3.3) Look at results of model via Confusion Matrix, Histogram Plots, and Scatter Plots

4) Radial Kernel
4.1) Tune the parameters Cost and Gamma (built class)
4.2) Fit model with best parameters
4.3) Look at results of model via Confusion Matrix, Histogram Plots, and Scatter Plots

5) Polynomial Kernel
5.1) Tune the parameters Cost, Coef0, and degree (built class)
5.2) Fit model with best parameters
5.3) Look at results of model via Confusion Matrix, Histogram Plots, and Scatter Plots

6) PDF Describing entire process and showing the formation of data, data description, tables, and graphs

PROJECT 2:
1) Exploration of Data
2) Feature Engineering
3) Reduction of Cases for project guidelines
4) Creating Classes for linear Regression Problem (total of 3 classes)
5) Standardize
6) Test Train Split (Designed Class)

7) Radial Kernel
7.1) Tune the parameters Cost and Gamma (both Grid Search and built class)
7.2) Fit model with best parameters
7.3) Look at results of model via Confusion Matrix, Histogram Plots, and Scatter Plots
7.4) Terminal Predictions using CDF from each SVM created for each class 1 vs all, 2 vs all, and 3 vs all
7.5) Terminal Confusion Matrix and analysis of model

8) Polynomial Kernel
8.1) Tune the parameters Cost and degree (both Grid Search and built class)
8.2) Fit model with best parameters
8.3) Look at results of model via Confusion Matrix, Histogram Plots, and Scatter Plots
8.4) Terminal Predictions using CDF from each SVM created for each class 1 vs all, 2 vs all, and 3 vs all
8.5) Terminal Confusion Matrix and analysis of model

9) PDF Describing entire process and showing the formation of data, data description, tables, and graphs
